This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and attempting to render items that have a `key` prop that is not unique.  React Native uses keys to identify and update items efficiently, and duplicate keys can cause unpredictable behavior and errors.  The error message itself can be vague, but usually relates to index-based rendering issues or unexpected behavior in updates.
